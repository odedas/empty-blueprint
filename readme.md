Also can use as a starter for existing code to refactor
## 🛠️ General Setup
```sh
mkdir try
cd try
npm init -y

```



 ## GIT - [optional]
  add git support
 ```sh
git init

    "semi": true,
    "arrowParens":"avoid",

    "trailingComma": "none"

  },
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript"]

### check for vulnerabilities and update all

```
$ npm audit fix --force
```
### Update All Node Packages to Latest

- Verify that your package.json is checked in to version control (the next command will overwrite the package.json)
- Update the package.json ncu --upgrade
- Validate the changes to your package.json
- Install the new packages npm install

# USE setup_blueprint.sh Script
To make the script available from anywhere on your Mac, you can follow these steps:

First download the blueprint project\
you can clone it from ()\
update the **$SOURCE_DIR** in the script to the cloned dir\
Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH: The simplest way is to move the script to a directory that's already in your **PATH**, such as **/usr/local/bin**.

```sh
mv /path/to/setup_blueprint.sh /usr/local/bin/setup_blueprint
```
Ensure the Script is Executable: If you haven't already, make sure the script is executable:

```sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup_blueprint
```
Open a New Terminal Window or Source Your Profile: For the changes to take effect in any currently open terminal windows, you might need to either open a new terminal window or source your profile:

```sh
source ~/.bash_profile  # For bash users
```
OR

```sh
source ~/.zshrc         # For zsh users (default in newer versions of macOS)
```
After doing this, you should be able to run the script from anywhere by simply typing 
```sh
setup_blueprint #name and path to your project
```
